## Bash Shell Customizations

Tired of typing out commonly used commands like `git status`?

Tired of your shell not doing basic things like removing duplicates from your history?

Look no further!

### Requirements

* You shell must be `bash`
* `git` must be installed

### Installation

```bash
./quick-install.bash [OPERATING_SYSTEM]
```

* *[OPERATING_SYSTEM] is optional, you will only get `general` if you omit it*
* *[OPERATING_SYSTEM] must be one of the folders in this repo (other than `general`)*

* [Vimrc (basic)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amix/vimrc/master/vimrcs/basic.vim)

### Tips

* You will not gain vim customizations if you already have `~/.vimrc`
* `~/.vimrc` will be created
